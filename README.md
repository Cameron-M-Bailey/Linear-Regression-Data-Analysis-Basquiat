# Linear-Regression-Data-Analysis-Basquiat
### An analysis of Basquiat’s top selling works & a multiple linear regression to predict prices.
# Objective 
This project analyzes Basquait’s top art pieces with the highest hammer prices (sale prices in auctions). Aspects such as dimensions (length, width, area), year created, number of unique colors, and others, were explored as features.

A multiple linear regression was implemented to estimate and predict hammer prices for Basquiat’s works. This can be used by art collectors to estimate their maximum bids for auctions, attain values for price negotiations, predict high-value pieces for maximal return on investment, and predict the value of their current Basquiat collection.
